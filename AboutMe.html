    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <h2><br><br>HELLO!</h2>
    <h3>My name is Ethan Karpinski.</h3>
    <p><br>I've been an artist my whole life. My grandma taught me when I was young, and I have developed my skills through the use of online videos and tutorials, along with a great amount of practice. I'm a sophomore at Michigan State University and I attended highschool in a small town just north of East Lansing. Formerly, I mostly painted and drew with colored pencils and markers, creating a few pictures to hang around the house or display on the fridge. During my Freshman year of college, however, I purchased an iPad for help managing my coursework.<br><br><b>Little did I know,<br></b><br>I was actually going to be flooded with art requests after experimenting on a drawing app and showing some friends. I created an Instagram page and started doing some minor advertisements to gain attention. I reached almost 100 followers on my instagram page and have done paid work for 25+ people. Click the link labeled "EthanDZNS TIKTOK" on the right side of your screen for an example of how I do my work. I'm not dedicating this as a full time job, but it is a hobby that I enjoy and can make a little bit of money on the side. My <b>FAVORITE</b> part of doing this is seeing someone's reaction after giving them their finished artwork.</p>
